# Results worker for str√§nge.de riddle generation

This repository contains the **results worker** microservice for generating riddles for [strangui](https://github.com/polarfoxDev/strangui).

## Overview

The results worker is a Go-based service that retrieves finished job results from a Redis query and stores them as JSON files in a specified directory.

## Features

- **JSON output** from generated riddles
- **Queue management** via Redis
- **Logging** with logrus for easy debugging and monitoring

## How It Works

1. The worker monitors the Redis queue `generate-riddle-result`.
2. Take the result from the queue.
3. Save it in a JSON file.

## Project Structure

[`main.go`](./main.go) contains most of the logic: a worker loop, Redis integration, configuration, logging and storing files.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+
- Redis server

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polarfoxDev/straenge-results-worker.git
cd straenge-results-worker
go mod tidy
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
REDIS_URL=localhost:6379
LOG_LEVEL=info
BASE_FILE_PATH=/path/to/save/riddles
```

### Running the Worker

Start the worker:

```bash
go run main.go
```
